# libasm
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming
language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong
(but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture’s
machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer
architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable
across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language
may also be called symbolic machine code.
